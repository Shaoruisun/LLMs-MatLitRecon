# Extracting and Reconstructing Knowledge in Material Science Literature Using Large Language Models
Overview
This project provides a generalized framework for reconstructing knowledge from inorganic materials science literature using advanced large language models (LLMs). The goal is to accelerate materials discovery by enabling large-scale, accurate, and consistent extraction of synthetic routes, properties, and other valuable scientific information from published articles.
